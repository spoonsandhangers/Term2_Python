"""
I have added this section, without learning OOP this is the way that we can
show how to use global and local variables.
Updating global variables in this way will lead into using OOP instance variables and methods.
Subroutines that return a value are called functions
They use the key word return
Follow the key word return with the value/variable you want to return.
Make sure that when you call the subroutine you assign the return value to a variable. See lines 31, 37 and 42.
